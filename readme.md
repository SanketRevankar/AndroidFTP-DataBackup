## Configuration
**Make sure to update the configuration file before running the code.**

 - FTP Connection Details. Replace `192.168.0.100` with the IP of your FTP Server and `2221`
 with the port set for the server.
```
IP: str = '192.168.0.100'
PORT: int = 2221
```

- FTP Credentials. Insert your username and password set on the FTP server in place of
`USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`.
```
USERNAME: str = 'USERNAME'
PASSWORD: str = 'PASSWORD'
```

- Base folder for storing backups. All the files will be stored with reference to this folder.
Make sure you have sufficient space to save your data. Replace `C:/Backup/` with the path
you want to store your data. Path should end with `/`.
```
DESTINATION_FOLDER: str = 'C:/Backup/'
```

- File to save last update timestamp, this is used for updating from last backup state.
Should be a valid filename. Separator should be `/`. Replace `C:/update_date.txt` with any name
of your choice.
```
UPDATE_DATE_TXT: str = 'C:/update_date.txt'
```

- List of Folders to backup
    - Format: List[str]
    ```
     [<source folder path>, <destination folder path>, <Empty String, Refer below comment for uses>]
    ```

    - 2 Elements in list -> Save backup to the folder mentioned, 
    create folders for Year/Month and save accordingly
    - Source path should not contain sdcard path, sdcard acts like the base folder by default.

```
FOLDERS: List[List[str]] = [
    ['WhatsApp/Media/WhatsApp Images', DESTINATION_FOLDER + 'Whatsapp/WhatsApp Images'],

    ['DCIM/Camera', DESTINATION_FOLDER + 'Camera'],
    ['Pictures/Screenshots', DESTINATION_FOLDER + 'Pictures/Screenshots', ''],
]
```

- Source path for WhatsApp DB. This will be the default path for WhatsApp Databases, change 
only if you are sure that you have some other path.
```
MSGSTORE_DB_CRYPT_: str = 'WhatsApp/Databases/msgstore.db.crypt12'
```

- Destination for WhatsApp DB. This will be the path to store the database backup, 
Replace `msgstore.db.crypt12` in case you want to store with some other name.
